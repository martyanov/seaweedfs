// Forget is called when the kernel discards entries from its
// dentry cache. This happens on unmount, and when the kernel
// is short on memory. Since it is not guaranteed to occur at
// any moment, and since there is no return value, Forget
// should not do I/O, as there is no channel to report back
// I/O errors.

/**
 * Forget about an inode
 *
 * This function is called when the kernel removes an inode
 * from its internal caches.
 *
 * The inode's lookup count increases by one for every call to
 * fuse_reply_entry and fuse_reply_create. The nlookup parameter
 * indicates by how much the lookup count should be decreased.
 *
 * Inodes with a non-zero lookup count may receive request from
 * the kernel even after calls to unlink, rmdir or (when
 * overwriting an existing file) rename. Filesystems must handle
 * such requests properly and it is recommended to defer removal
 * of the inode until the lookup count reaches zero. Calls to
 * unlink, rmdir or rename will be followed closely by forget
 * unless the file or directory is open, in which case the
 * kernel issues forget only after the release or releasedir
 * calls.
 *
 * Note that if a file system will be exported over NFS the
 * inodes lifetime must extend even beyond forget. See the
 * generation field in struct fuse_entry_param above.
 *
 * On unmount the lookup count for all inodes implicitly drops
 * to zero. It is not guaranteed that the file system will
 * receive corresponding forget messages for the affected
 * inodes.
 *
 * Valid replies:
 *   fuse_reply_none
 *
 * @param req request handle
 * @param ino the inode number
 * @param nlookup the number of lookups to forget
